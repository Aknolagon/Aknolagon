Hello everyone who is visiting my profile !!

My name is Prasanna KALKI. I'm a Web and Web Mobile Developer ðŸ˜Ž

I love to travel around the globe, just came back to the game after a big gap in my life.

I started my career working as a Business Developper few years ago.

After that experience, I wanted to work in something that was close to my heart.

That's why, I started a training at the Wild Code School to become a Web and Web Mobile Developer.
