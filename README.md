Hello to everyone who visits my profile!!

My name is Prasanna KALKI. I am a Web and Mobile Web Developer ðŸ˜Ž

I love traveling the world, having just returned to the market after a big hiatus in my life.

I started my career as a Business Developer a few years ago.

After this experience, I wanted to work in a field that was close to my heart.

This is why I started a training at the Wild Code School and now I became a Web and Mobile Web Developer.
